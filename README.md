📚 Book Recommendation System | Collaborative Filtering | Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a Book Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and Cosine Similarity to suggest books based on user preferences. The dataset includes books, users, and ratings data, enabling personalized recommendations based on reading patterns.

🔹 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, filters out noise, and structures data for analysis.
Popular Books Filtering: Identifies books with a high number of ratings and average rating.
User-Based Filtering: Filters out users with a significant number of ratings to ensure meaningful recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes a User-Item Interaction Matrix to compute similarity scores using Cosine Similarity.
Recommendation System: Retrieves top book recommendations based on similarity scores.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn)
Scikit-learn (cosine similarity for recommendations)
Data Handling: Pandas for merging, filtering, and structuring data
Machine Learning: Collaborative Filtering for personalized recommendations
📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of three CSV files:

Books.csv – Contains book details like title, author, and publication year.
Users.csv – Includes user demographic data (location, age).
Ratings.csv – Contains explicit book ratings given by users.
🚀 How It Works
Load and Preprocess Data: Handles missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Filter Users and Books: Retains books and users with sufficient interactions to improve recommendation accuracy.
Create User-Item Matrix: Converts ratings data into a structured pivot table.
Compute Similarity Scores: Uses Cosine Similarity to identify similar books.
Generate Recommendations: Returns top N most similar books based on user preferences.
🔥 Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
recommend('Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2)')
🔹 Output:

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3)" – J.K. Rowling
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book 4)" – J.K. Rowling
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1)" – J.K. Rowling
📌 Future Enhancements
Implement Content-Based Filtering using book descriptions and genres.
Integrate Deep Learning models (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering).
Build a Web Application for an interactive recommendation system.
